# sentimentAnalysis
In this project I created a sentiment analysis system using the Spelling Checker and Wordnet combined with the K-NN, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree methods. Of the three methods, then I want to compare the results of the calculation of accuracy before and after using the spelling checker and wordnet. I made this project using the Python programming language.
